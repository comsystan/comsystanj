29.2.1.2

New-----------------------------------------------------------
2D Image - Correlation dimension
2D Image - Directional correlation dimension
2D Image - Generalized fractal dimensions
2D Image - Minkowski dimension
2D Image - FFT Dimension
2D Image - Tug of war dimension
2D Image - Fractal fragmentation indices (FFI and FFDI)
2D Image - Lacunarity
2D Image - Succolarity
2D Image - Generalized entropies
Signal - Permutation entropy
Signal - Katz dimension
Signal - Petrosian dimension
Signal - Sevcik dimension

Bugfix--------------------------------------------------------
2D Image - Kolmogorov complexcity - Did register as signal plugin
2D Image - Higuchi1D - Roundig errors from rad to grad for lables, angles now in grad
2D Image - Image Opener - Did not open grey image stack correctly
2D Image - Box counting - Check maximal number of boxes
2D Image - Pyramid dimension - Subsampling with averaging
2D Image - Image Generator - JTransforms FFT instead of ImgLib2 FFT for fractal surfaces
Signal - HRV - Subsequent boxes did not compute frequency mesurements because subdomain values did not start with zero

Miscellaneous-------------------------------------------------
- Signal - HRV added an ULF band, changed main freqency domain measurement units to ms^2
- Previous images are now succesfully deleted for "Overwrite" option and focus is set to input image
- Added plugin menu weights
- Changed option "Delete" to "Overwrite"
- Changed option "Preview" to "Immediate processing"
- Changed some persist entries
