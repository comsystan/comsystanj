**************************************************************
Version 2.0.0
pom-scijava 31.1.0

Major change:
Changed UI type from InteractiveCommand to ContextCommand for all plugins.
The UI is now modal.
This allows the use of ComsystanJ in macros.
But unfortunately, interactivity of plugins is lost.

New
Signal - RSE dimension

Bugfix
2D Image - Pyramid dimension - Subsampling of images
2D Image - Higuchi1D - Improved averaging for radial line extraction
2D Image - Lacunarity - Eliminated unnecessary regression min max settings
2D Image - Succolarity - Eliminated unnecessary regression min max settings

Miscellaneous
Signal - Cut - Renamed to Cutout

Known issues
Red cast of RGB color images

**************************************************************
Version 1.0.1
pom-scijava 29.2.1

New
2D Image - Correlation dimension
2D Image - Directional correlation dimension
2D Image - Generalized fractal dimensions
2D Image - Minkowski dimension
2D Image - FFT Dimension
2D Image - Tug of war dimension
2D Image - Fractal fragmentation indices (FFI and FFDI)
2D Image - Lacunarity
2D Image - Succolarity
2D Image - Generalized entropies
Signal - Permutation entropy
Signal - Katz dimension

Bugfix
2D Image - Kolmogorov complexcity - Did register as signal plugin
2D Image - Higuchi1D - Roundig errors from rad to grad for lables, angles now in grad
2D Image - Image opener - Did not open grey image stack correctly
2D Image - Box counting - Check maximal number of boxes
2D Image - Pyramid dimension - Subsampling with averaging
2D Image - Image generator - JTransforms FFT instead of ImgLib2 FFT for fractal surfaces
2D Image - Image generator - Added Hirarchical random maps 
Signal - Signal generator - Added Weierstra√ü-Mandelbrot signals
Signal - HRV - Subsequent boxes did not compute frequency mesurements because subdomain values did not start with zero

Miscellaneous
- Signal - HRV added an ULF band, changed main freqency domain measurement units to ms^2
- Previous images are now succesfully deleted for "Overwrite" option and focus is set to input image
- Added plugin menu weights
- Changed option "Delete" to "Overwrite"
- Changed option "Preview" to "Immediate processing"
- Changed some persist entries
