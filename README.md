ComsystanJ (Complex Systems Analysis for ImageJ) is a collection of Fiji/ImageJ2 plugins to compute the complexity, entropy, fractal dimension and other nonlinear measures of 1D signals, 2D images and 3D image volumes.

Installation

Download a ComsystanJ release from [https://github.com/comsystan/comsystanj/releases](https://github.com/comsystan/comsystanj/releases).
Unpack the *.zip file and copy the whole folder to the plugins folder of Fiji. Alternatively, the ComsystanJ *.jar files can be imported using the Fiji command Plugins/Install. Starting Fiji, the ComsystanJ plugins appear under Plugins/ComsystanJ.

To update ComsystanJ, the old ComsystanJ folder must be replaced with a new folder.

Fiji should be up to date, and the SCIFIO option (Edit/Options/ImageJ2) must be enabled.

It is recommended to download a clean copy of the latest Fiji version from the Fiji archive [https://downloads.imagej.net/fiji/archive](https://downloads.imagej.net/fiji/archive).
