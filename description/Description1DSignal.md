  - The box size should not be larger than 1/3 of the signal length 
  - The number of subsequent boxes is (signal length)/(box size)
  - The number of gliding boxes is (signal length)-(box size)
  - Note: The number of subsequent and particularly of gliding boxes can be very high

### Fractal analyses - Sevcik dimension
- Gives better results than Katz dimension
- Signal lengths are computed by Euclidean distances 
- Signals should be opened with the CSAJ Signal Opener
- Optional surrogate data analysis
- Analysis of Entire signal or Subsequent/Gliding boxes
- Notes for Subsequent/Gliding box:
  - The box size should not be larger than 1/3 of the signal length 
  - The number of subsequent boxes is (signal length)/(box size)
  - The number of gliding boxes is (signal length)-(box size)
  - Note: The number of subsequent and particularly of gliding boxes can be very high

### Fractal analyses - Tug of war dimension
- Binary [0, >0] algorithm!
- The number of boxes with distinct sizes according to the power of 2 can be set
- Linear regression parameters of the double log plot can be set 
- The ToW algorithm is a statistical approach and is dependent on the accuracy and confidence settings
- In the original paper accuracy=30 and confidence=5  
- But it is recommended to set accuracy and confidence as high as computation times allow
- Signals should be opened with the CSAJ Signal Opener
- Optional surrogate data analysis
- Analysis of Entire signal or Subsequent/Gliding boxes
- Note for Entire signal:
  - Number of Boxes should not be larger than 1/3 of the signal length
- Notes for Subsequent/Gliding box:
  - Number of boxes should not be larger than 1/3 of the box size
  - The box size should not be larger than 1/3 of the signal length 
  - The number of subsequent boxes is (signal length)/(box size)
  - The number of gliding boxes is (signal length)-(box size)
  - Note: The number of subsequent and particularly of gliding boxes can be very high

  ### Fractal analyses - Walking divider dimension
- Intended for 2D images!
- Input columns are expected to be x,y coordinates of a contour in a 2D image
- Only for even number of columns (pairwise x,y coordinates)
- Regression parameters can be set
- Sequences should be opened with the CSAJ Signal Opener
- Optional surrogate data analysis
- Analysis of Entire signal or Subsequent/Gliding boxes
- Notes for Subsequent/Gliding box:
  - The box size should not be larger than 1/3 of the sequence length 
  - The number of subsequent boxes is (sequence length)/(box size)
  - The number of gliding boxes is (sequence length)-(box size)
  - Note: The number of subsequent and particularly of gliding boxes can be very high
